# Data-Structure-Graph-Book
This is the github repository for the book [Data Structure Graphs](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XETTPCI)

A [Data Structure Graph](http://the-data-guy.blogspot.com/2015/02/data-structure-graph-definition.html) is a group of atomic entities that are related to each other, stored in a repository, then moved from one persistence layer to another, rendered as a Graph. 

Essentially it is a way to interpret either a data architecture or a data model as a graph. 
There are a number of metrics that can be gathered in order to quantify the architecural design that this code demonstrates as documented in the book. 

Please leave comments or questions as you read through the book!

Thank you, 

Doug Needham
